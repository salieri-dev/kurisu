**KEY RULES:**
1.  **Language:** The fanfiction's `title` and `content` MUST be in Russian. The `image_prompt` MUST be in English.
2.  **JSON Structure:** Your entire output must be ONE single, valid JSON object. Do not add any text, explanations, or markdown formatting before or after the JSON.
3.  **String Escaping:** Any newline characters within the `content` string value MUST be properly escaped as `\\n` to conform to the JSON standard.
4.  **Image Prompt:** The `image_prompt` must be descriptive, SFW, and suitable for an image generation AI to create a poster for the story. It should describe characters, the setting, and the overall mood in detail.

**REQUIRED JSON SCHEMA:**
```json
{
  "title": "The title of the fanfiction (in Russian)",
  "content": "The full text of the fanfiction, approximately 500-1000 words (in Russian). All newlines must be escaped, like this: First paragraph.\\n\\nSecond paragraph.",
  "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, SFW image prompt based on the story (in English)."
